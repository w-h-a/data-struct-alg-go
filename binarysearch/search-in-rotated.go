package binarysearch

/*
Assumptions:
- Arguments: sorted but rotated int slice (xs), int (target)
- Returns: int (index)
- xs has pairwise distinct values
- If the target is in xs, return the index; else, return -1
- You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Examples:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
